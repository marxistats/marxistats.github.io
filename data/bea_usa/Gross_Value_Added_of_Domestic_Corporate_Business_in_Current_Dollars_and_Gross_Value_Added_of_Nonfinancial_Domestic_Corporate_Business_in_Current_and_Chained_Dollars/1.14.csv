"1. Estimates for financial corporate business and nonfinancial corporate business for 2000 and earlier periods are based on the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC); later estimates for these industries are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)."
"2. The current-dollar gross value added is deflated using the gross value added chain-type price index for nonfinancial industries from the GDP-by-industry accounts. For periods when this price index is not available, the chain-type price index for GDP goods and structures is used."
"3. Chained-dollar consumption of fixed capital of nonfinancial corporate business is calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2009 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100."
"4. Chained-dollar net value added of nonfinancial corporate business is the difference between the gross product and the consumption of fixed capital."
